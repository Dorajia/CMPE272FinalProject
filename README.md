# CMPE272FinalProject
This is a project for CMPE272.

The general domain of this project focuses on cloud computing, big data, and presenting users a visual of commute times using Muni Metro (Muni), a light rail and street car transportation system, in San Francisco, California. It emulates a similar project done by the WNYC concerning New York City commute times by subway and train. WNYC is an American public radio station. Our project, however, deals with Muni Metro because BART and CalTrain routes are limited within the city. The target audience of this project are people commuting within SF by public transit, people considering to live in SF, and tourists planning their travels within the city.
